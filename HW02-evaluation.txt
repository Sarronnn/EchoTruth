Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2 a componenet-based architecture would work, but do you really need to
have all that overhead of communication when a monolithic architecture might
be sufficient?  You make some good points, though...

On 5.4 the hybrid approach you mention is an interesting idea!  Good for you
for thinking outside the box.

On 5.8 Nice work on your drawing.

Problem 6.2 is missing.  RATS!

Otherwise, good job, keep up the good work!
