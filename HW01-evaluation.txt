Comments:
---------

problem 4.2 the critical path should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q making 32 days.
   Your duration is correct but the tasks are wrong.

problem 4.4 you are using problem 4.2 for this, so 4.4 is omitted.

problem 4.4 you are starting your schedule on Monday when the problem states
   that January 1 is a WEDNESDAY.  You also are not allowing for specified
   holidays so your developers will not be happy.

problem 4.8 these are important considerations, but they aren't addressing
   task tracking, which is what the question was about; since your answer is
   important, though.... :D

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty
   several of the requirements fit in more than one category

problem 5.9 good use of MoSCoW, especially keeping the W's around for later.

Good work on this one ~~ keep it up!
