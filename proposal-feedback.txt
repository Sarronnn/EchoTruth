Proposal Document:
------------------
   INCREDIBLE work on the document.  There is so much more than the normal
   requirement for the proposal here.  You did great with this!

   Because it's so complete, you won't have too much more work to do for
   putting much of the rest of your documentation together.

   I really admire the relevance, timeliness, and social focus of this
   project.  I'm glad to see something with some 'meat' in it, and not just
   another game, even a 'socially relevant' game....  *grin*

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Your presentation went well today!  I like that you are all participating
   and you did a pretty good job of talking to the audience.  The slides are
   very nice, minimal text so the audience focuses on your talk not them.  A
   very good job overal.

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
