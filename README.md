# EchoTruth
EchoTruth is an innovative technology project focused on distinguishing fact from fiction in today's fast-paced information landscape. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop a reliable fake news detection system, capable of analyzing and verifying the authenticity of news content.

The goal of EchoTruth is to serve as a digital sentinel, promoting the dissemination of accurate and trustworthy information. By filtering out fake news, EchoTruth aspires to foster a more informed and discerning public. This project is crucial in an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, impacting public opinion, decision-making processes, and even democratic institutions.





**Instructions on how to use EchoTruth** 

TODO: Include any commands or scripts to run the system**

TODO: Include examples demonstrating how to input data and interpret the output.

# Datasets Used


- **Dataset Used for Training**: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes a diverse range of news articles labeled as 'true' or 'fake'. You can access and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification).

TODO: Add a description of the dataset, including the types of articles it contains, the labeling process, and any preprocessing steps performed.
Include explanation of the data preprocessing steps.

# Acknowledgments
We extend our heartfelt thanks to Loyola Marymount University and the Computer Science Department for giving us the opportunity to work on this project. The experience has not only enhanced our skills but also provided us with invaluable knowledge that we will carry with us into the future.

# Current status of Model:

The model currently achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the training set and about 73% on the validation set. Given the critical nature of this project—a fake news detector demanding high accuracy—deploying the model with a 73% validation accuracy is not advisable. Achieving this level of accuracy represents a significant milestone, especially considering our team's initial lack of expertise in machine learning. Although we intended to refine the model further, the conclusion of the school year has paused our progress. We plan to continue enhancing the model's performance by experimenting with different algorithms in the next phase of our project. With Sarron graduating, Kalif and Dev will lead the project's next steps in the upcoming semester.
