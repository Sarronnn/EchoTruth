# EchoTruth

EchoTruth is an exciting machine learning adventure aimed at separating truth from fiction in our rapidly evolving information era. Using cutting-edge machine learning strategies, our goal is to create a dependable fake news detector that can scrutinize news content and verify its authenticity with precision.

In a time where misinformation can quickly influence public opinion, sway decision-making, and even affect democratic processes, the need for such a tool has never been more critical. Our plan is to develop a highly accurate model and then roll it out for users, empowering them to navigate the media landscape with confidence and discernment.


# Datasets Used


- **Dataset Used for Training**: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes a diverse range of news articles labeled as 'true' or 'fake'. You can access and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification).

# Acknowledgments
We extend our heartfelt thanks to Loyola Marymount University and the Computer Science Department for giving us the opportunity to work on this project. The experience has not only enhanced our skills but also provided us with invaluable knowledge that we will carry with us into the future.

# Current status of Model:

The model currently achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the training set and about 73% on the validation set. Given the critical nature of this project—a fake news detector demanding high accuracy—deploying the model with a 73% validation accuracy is not advisable. Achieving this level of accuracy represents a significant milestone, especially considering our team's initial lack of expertise in machine learning. Although we intended to refine the model further, the conclusion of the school year has paused our progress. We plan to continue enhancing the model's performance by experimenting with different algorithms in the next phase of our project. With Sarron graduating, Kalif and Dev will lead the project's next steps in the upcoming semester.
