Your score: 45 out of 50 = 90% which is an A-minus

Comments/feedback:

Problem 7-1: good catches on the syntax problems, but the problem is really
   about the comments...

Problem 7-5: you make a good case here, but don't forget that if your code
   will throw an exception you need to CATCH that exception in the CALLER,
   not in the CALLED function.

Problem 8-11: you only have one case of the Lincoln index.  You need to find
   all three and average them together.


Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
