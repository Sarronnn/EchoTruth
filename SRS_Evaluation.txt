Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   The introduction sections are wonderful!  I'm curious, though about the
   operating environment.  Will users be required to access the Jupyter or
   Colab tools to run your software?  If so, will you be providing specific
   instructions for installation and operation for all platforms?  There are
   many people who have Windows and/or Linux machines...

-- Functional Requirements
   A system like this needs a LOT more functional requirements than just 4.
   Try to come up with more for each of your sub-categories.  For example,
   will you be developing your own ML model, or using a known one?  If you
   are doing the second option, you need to specify which one.  If there is
   documentation for it, section 1.4 should have a link to that.

   Watch out for weasel words like "comprehensive dataset".  What do you
   mean by that term?  Try to be explicit.

-- Performance Requirements
   The one requirement here is good, but see if you can think of a few more.
   It doesn't have to be a lot, just one or two more.  Also, is the "95" a
   percent?  If so, say so.  Lastly, if it's 95%, how will you test the
   accuracy of the result to prove it is 95%?  Specify a requirement for it.

   You really don't need to specify the interface, security, or software
   attribute requirements for this project, but good to see you are thinking
   about them!

-- Environment Requirements
   I don't see anything about these in your document.  What system will you
   develop on?  What system will the user need to run the application when
   it is deployed?  What are the specifics in terms of memory requirements,
   processor, graphics processor, operating system versions, etc.?

=============================================================================
your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
